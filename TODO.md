#Broken things, stuff I ran into, future updates
* push to NPM
* verify the app name, so when you typo it doesnt just make a folder and app with a typo'd name (who knows how big some peoples generators may be)
* some form of symlink check. Because this is installed globally it should let you choose where to keep your generators and make a symlink to that.
* make the console friendlier. maybe add numbers to the generator list so you dont have to type out the name, etc.
* stop being lazy about tests
